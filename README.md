# Heart-Disease-Risk-Prediction-Using-Patient-Records

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the top contributor of death globally, highlighting the urgent need for precise, data-driven risk prediction systems. This research aims to implement AI methods to estimate the possibility of heart diseases using the structured clinical dataset Heart.csv, which includes information of the patients namely age_group, gender, lipid profile, pressure of blood flow, and electrocardiographic findings.
I developed and evaluated multiple predictive systems, including Random_Forest, Na√Øve-Bayes, & ensemble techniques, specifically XGBoost. These models were tuned to categorize patient risk levels and identify patterns associated with cardiovascular events. The random_forest achieves the highest precision and robustness across validation sets.
To ensure clinical relevance and trust, we incorporated model explainability tools such as LIME values and feature importance analysis, which consistently highlighted features like ST_segment, MaxHR, Oldpeak, and resting ECG results as top contributors to predictions.
Additionally, a user-centric web interface was created to allow medical practitioners to add individual-specific data and obtain real-time, individualized risk assessments. This approach demonstrates the potential of intelligent health systems to support proactive cardiovascular support and facilitate timely clinical interventions.
